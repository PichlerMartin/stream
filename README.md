# installation instructions:
 download or clone the zipped repository and open the project in
 IntelliJ IDEA. now you can compile and run the programm
 in the JVM.
 
 in order to run stream perfectly you are required to have java installed. If your computer is not one of the 3 Billion lucky devices yet, its about time. access your webbrowser and dwonload java from the oracle website, after that follow the installation instructions of the installer. now you can continue with the JDK:
 (JDK)https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/JDK_Howto.html
 
 after that has happened, follow the link below to get instructions on how to install the IDE IntelliJ IDEA:
 https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/windows/intellij-idea-win.html
 
 you're almost there! now you need to set up the downloaded repository in IntelliJ IDEA. a guide to do so is listed below:

 important: in this stage of development you need the free software "betternet vpn" in order to induce your downloads. download it here:
 https://www.betternet.co/
 
 after that you can open the project in your intellij idea environment, navigate to the folder "testui" and start the file UI_Main.java (the one with the green arrow) after that the software starts and load a test sequence. more functionality is sadly not implemented yet
 
 if you'd like to see a demo of the ui start the file UI_Main.java in the folder "streamUI"
 
 if you fell a little confident you can try to set up an jar artifact an run said, but that hasn't been tested jet ...
 
 stay tuned for more breathtaking updates and the upcomming ui!
