# packages and classes
  this folder contains the source code and packages created by the project team
  
  client is a collection revolving around the class StreamClient which is the main-initiating class from where the various functions of our application are started (downloads, ...)
  
  filelibrary is a side-project. it essentially conveys the idea of a mini-filesystem which shall be used to better organize the different files involved in the application. it will be further worked out in a future update
  
  dowload contains helper-methods needed in "client"
  
  meta contains the file "Globals.class" which contains various static constants need for purposes e.g. testing
  
  streamUI contains the final controller which interacts with the user interface, it was mainly developed by Topeiner Marcel and further refined by Pichler Martin in the "ui-connection"-phase of the project
  
  support is very similar to meta
  
  testui and sample were created in the early project phase to test different ui-related applications
