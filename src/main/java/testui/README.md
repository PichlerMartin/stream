# further explanation:

this package was created during summer 2019, at the start of the programming work. it served as a simple and functionality-centered user interface in order to test some gimmicks and ideas. after several months this package became deprecated, but it is still being continuously archived and look after for because of its functions which may be further pursued in the streamUI package (the ui main package)
